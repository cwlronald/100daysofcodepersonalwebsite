              <p class = "intro">I don't like following the crowd. Sometimes I find other ways, sometimes I swim against the current and try not to drown. I hope this simple website will be something fond to look back to in a few years from now, after I take over the world.</p>

                <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
                <p>Analytics was something I stumbled into while looking for a way out from accounting. One internship at Tableau was all it took. I've been working in analytics roles with a heavy emphasis on Tableau (no seriously, i'm really good at it), but I'm still able to do Python and SQL. Now I'm looking to reinvent myself further. </p>

                <h3>All-in Investing</h3>
                <p>Despite being a learned person when it comes to investing (I tell myself that when i go to sleep), I only invest in a few things, Tesla, Bitcoin, Cathie. I believe that, in 20-30 years, buying Tesla in the 2020s would have been the most braindead 69/420 investment any moron couldve made. Same goes for Bitcoin.</p>

                <h3>Collectibles</h3>
                <p>I started investing in Pokemon cards in 2017. To date, half my networth is in the hobby. My only regret thus far? I didn't buy more. My most expensive card was purchased in 2020, 20k USD, 162 copies. Last thing i'll sell thats for sure.</p>
